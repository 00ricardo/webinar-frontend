### Init your Ionic Angular app
Follow these steps to get started with your Book Database application.
### Installation
Ionic Angular requires Node.js to run. To install it click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). The LTS version is recommended.

Make sure it is working by running:
```sh
node --version
npm --version
```

For any problems check https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment

##### 1 - Install the Ionic CLI. Open command line and type:

```sh
npm install -g @ionic/cli

```

For any problems check https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli


##### 2 (Optional) - How to create an app (not necessary for this tutorial, as you already have an app to work with). Open command line and type:

```sh
ionic start

```

When it asks you if you want to use the creation wizard type no. Then, select the framework to use (Angular) and the name for the project. You will be asked to pick a template from different options. And that's it! Now just wait for it to finish (you can just type no for the prompts that show up when it finishes).

##### 3 - Install Node Modules. Go to the project folder, open command line and type:

```sh
npm install

```

##### 4 - Running the app. Go to the project folder, open command line and type:

```sh
ionic serve

```

###### WARNING: You should use Google Chrome to view the application, as there is an incompatability in terms of the date format in browsers such as Firefox.
